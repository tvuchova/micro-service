# micro-service

Architectures are moving towards microservices. RESTful web services are the first step to developing great microservices. Java and Spring Boot, in combination with Spring Web MVC (also called Spring REST) makes it easy to develop RESTful web services.

With this examples I establish communication between microservices, enable load balancing, scaling up and down of microservices. I also centralize configuration of microservices with Spring Cloud Config Server. Also is implemented Eureka Naming Server and Distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin. I create fault toleranct microservices with Zipkin.
